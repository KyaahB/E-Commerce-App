# E-Commerce-App



## Description
This is E-Commerce-App is a backend website. This app uses MySql and Sequelize alog with the use of Routes to update, delete, add and look at items in the code. The user is able to do this through the use of Insomnia, which is the API testing tool I used to test and run my routes. Mysql takes the information in the seed files and formats them into tables which are pushed to insomnia when the server is ran in the console. Insomnia then runs through the routes to get, get by id, post, delete and put as such.
